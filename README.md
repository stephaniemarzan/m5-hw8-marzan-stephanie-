Box Assignment

My man issue with this assignment is that my loop was not running. My first mistake was that I had the logic of my function outside of my loop. Once I moved it, it was still not running because I was converting my boxClicked variable to an integer in order to compare it to a random number but was not saving this value as a variable. 

Additionally, I was only using one equal sign in the condition of my if statement, which caused a statement rather than a comparison of values.

Lastly, I was using a for loop to provide the losing message instead of using a random number to generate one of the messages.
